## Lab 2 for GEOG 495 - Web GIS

The website I created for this lab is a website of some popular shaved ice from around the world. There is a navigation
bar at the top of the website to easily navigate to a country's version of shaved ice. Each country on the site includes
a recipe that the reader can try out.
