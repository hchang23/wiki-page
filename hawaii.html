            In the mid-1800s, Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii to work on plantations brought with them <i>kakigori</i>, which grew
            in popularity. The immigrants would use their tools to get shaved ice from large blocks of ice and then adding sugar or
            fruit juice, which is easily absorbed by the ice due to it being finely shaved like powder. Fresh, local fruits such as
            coconut, papaya, or passionfruit are used as toppings or fuit syrups/juice; ice cream is usually added at the core; and
            adzuki beans are a common topping.

            <li>Whisk in the mango pulp, then transfer to a squeeze bottle and set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, whisk the jam together in a bowl with the hot water. </li>
